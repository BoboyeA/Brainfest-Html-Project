		<p> Grey's Anatomy is an American television series that first aired on March 27, 2005 on ABC . The action takes
			place at
			the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital (later: Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital , then Gray Sloan Memorial
			Hospital ) in
			Seattle and describes the lives of five residents around the main character Meredith Grey. The title of the
			series is an
			allusion , as it refers to the main character's last name, but in the pronunciation with that of the
			standard medical
			work Gray's Anatomy by Henry Grayis identical. The series has received several awards, including Emmys and
			Golden Globes
