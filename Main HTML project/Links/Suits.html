		<p> Mike Ross pays for his grandmother's elderly care. As her condition worsens, he must find $25,000 to get her
			the best
			treatment possible. That's why he wants to work once as a drug dealer through his friend Trevor. At the
			drop-off point
			in the hotel, he realizes that he is falling into a trap. He flees and bursts into an interview for a law
			firm. Harvey
			Specter, one of New York's most respected and notorious top attorneys, recognizes Mike's talent and is
			impressed by his
			photographic memory. He hires him as a lawyer, even though he has no training. Over the course of the
			series, in which
			the two of them and their colleagues solve new cases, often in shady ways, Mike's illegal practice as a
			lawyer becomes a
			problem again and again.</p>
