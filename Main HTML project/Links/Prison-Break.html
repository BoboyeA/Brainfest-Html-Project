		<p>Prison Break is an American action series by author Paul Scheuring that was produced from 2005 to 2009 and
			continued in
			2017. It currently consists of 90 episodes divided into five seasons. The first broadcast took place from
			August 29,
			2005 on the US television channel Fox . A direct sequel was released in 2010 with the film Prison Break -
			The Final
			Break . In August 2015, production of a nine-part fifth season was announced, which began airing on Fox on
			April 4,
			2017. In early January 2018, Prison Break was announced to be renewed for a sixth season. [1]This
			announcement was
			essentially withdrawn on August 9, 2019. "Scheuring had previously emphasized that it was not easy to
			develop another
			convincing story after five seasons." On November 8, 2020, Wentworth Miller announced on his Instagram
			account that he
			wanted to devote himself to gay roles in the future and therefore the role of Michael Scofield will no
			longer play.</p>
